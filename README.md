# dzScript - - Coming Soon!
a shitty script + installer to get PowerColor DevilZone to work in tandem with OpenRGB

## Story

My PC is real bright. I want to leave my PC running overnight to seed stuff. I want to save about 3 seconds by just pressing a button to turn off all the RGB instead of opening OpenRGB manually.
Oh and I have a PowerColor 5700XT GPU - unsupported by OpenRGB. 

So I made this AHK script that loads an OpenRGB profile with all the lights off + opens DevilZone and sets the color to black. Press the button again to turn it all on via a different OpenRGB profile.

You will have to use Window Spy and set the mouse position for where the Red value is in DevilZone and the Apply button. You will also have to add G and B values and mouse positions if you dont want it to be red.

**Do yourself a favor and just download the AHK file** if you are one of the 4 people on earth this script may help - the installer is just me having fun and figuring out how to make one.

## Releases

Do NOT Download the latest installer and binaries from the [Releases page](https://github.com/Nav-one/dzScript/releases) !

I am not sure if this even works yet.
